# Product Guidelines: Receipts Management System

## Communication Tone
- **Minimalist and Efficient:** The system's communication focuses on brevity and speed. UI text, notifications, and reports should provide only essential information, using clear and concise language to minimize cognitive load and maximize user efficiency.

## Error Handling & Reconciliation
- **Direct and Action-Oriented:** When discrepancies or errors occur, the system clearly highlights the issue and provides immediate, single-click actions to resolve it. The goal is to minimize the time the user spends in an "error state."

## User Interface Design
- **Focus and Task-Based:** The web portal dashboard prioritizes the most critical "Next Action." Whether it's uploading a new receipt or resolving a specific reconciliation conflict, the primary goal for the user's current session should be visually dominant.
- **Visual Priority:** Reduce clutter by hiding secondary information and focusing on active tasks.

## Data & File Management
- **Automated Standardization:** To ensure a clean and searchable audit trail, the system automatically renames all uploaded files to a standard format (e.g., `YYYY-MM-DD_Merchant_Amount.pdf`) using data extracted via OCR.
- **Consistency:** Standardized naming conventions are applied project-wide to facilitate easy retrieval and organization.

## Reporting & Visualization
- **Simple and High-Contrast:** Reports utilize basic, high-contrast charts (bar, line, pie) with clear labels. The priority is immediate understanding of financial data and reconciliation status without requiring complex interaction.
